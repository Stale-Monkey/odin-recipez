            This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe 
            with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a 
            deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna 
            filling would be made with ricotta 
            but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of 
            small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. 
            I have found none better anywhere. 
            Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.
